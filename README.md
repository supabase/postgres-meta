## Quickstart

Set the following ENV VARS:

```bash
PG_META_PORT=8080
PG_META_DB_HOST="postgres"
PG_META_DB_NAME="postgres"
PG_META_DB_USER="postgres"
PG_META_DB_PORT=5432
PG_META_DB_PASSWORD="postgres"
```

Then run any of the binaries in the releases.

## FAQs

**Why?**

This serves as a light-weight connection pooler. It also normalises the Postgres system catalog into a more readable format. While it it a lot of reinventing right now, this server will eventually provide helpers (such as type generators). The server is multi-tenant, so it can support multiple Postgres databases from a single server.

**What security does this use?**

None. Please don't use this as a standalone server. This should be used behind a proxy in a trusted environment, on your local machine, or using this internally with no access to the outside world. 

## Developers

1. Start the database using `docker-compose -f test/db/docker-compose.yml up`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Run `npm test` while you work

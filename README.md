## Quickstart

Set the following ENV VARS:

```bash
PG_META_HOST="0.0.0.0"
PG_META_PORT=8080
PG_META_DB_HOST="postgres"
PG_META_DB_NAME="postgres"
PG_META_DB_USER="postgres"
PG_META_DB_PORT=5432
PG_META_DB_PASSWORD="postgres"
```

Then run any of the binaries in the releases.

## FAQs

**Why?**

This serves as a light-weight connection pooler. It also normalises the Postgres system catalog into a more readable format. While there is a lot of re-inventing right now, this server will eventually provide helpers (such as type generators). The server is multi-tenant, so it can support multiple Postgres databases from a single server.

**What security does this use?**

None. Please don't use this as a standalone server. This should be used behind a proxy in a trusted environment, on your local machine, or using this internally with no access to the outside world. 

## Developers

To start developing, run `npm run dev`. It will set up the database with Docker for you. The server will restart on file change.

If you are fixing a bug, you should create a new test case. To test your changes, add the `-u/--updateSnapshot` flag to `jest` on the `test:run` script, run `npm run test`, and then review the git diff of the snapshots. Depending on your change, you may see `id` fields being changed - this is expected and you are free to commit it, as long as it passes the CI. Don't forget to remove the `-u/--updateSnapshot` flag when committing.

To make changes to the TypeScript type generation, run `npm run gen:types:typescript` while you have `npm run dev` running.
To use your own database connection string instead of the provided test database, run:
`PG_META_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres npm run gen:types:typescript`

## FAQs

**What security does this use?**

None. Please don't use this as a standalone server. We are assuming you are using this behind a proxy which brings its own security, on your local machine, or using this internally with no access to the outside world. This is designed to be used as a part of a larger system.

## Developers

1. Start the database using `docker-compose up`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Run `npm test` while you work

## Licence

Apache 2.0
